<span class="Comment">After reading the blog article &quot;Why Can't Programmers..Program?&quot;</span>

<span class="Comment">Here's my FizzBuzz with Pascal.</span>

<span class="Comment">The code can be execute online at:</span>
<span class="Comment"><a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_pascal_compiler">https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_pascal_compiler</a></span>

<span class="Comment">To Pascal any text between a left brace and a right brace are</span>
<span class="Comment">comments and are not executable code.</span>

<span class="Comment">I got my MS in Computer Science Advanced Algorithm course and 3D Graphics</span>
<span class="Comment">course using Pascal code.  </span>
<span class="Comment">Pascal was used by universities to teach programming. It was also taught</span>
<span class="Comment">in some high schools, since the college advanced placement test used</span>
<span class="Comment">Pascal. Today AP tests use Java.</span>

<span class="Comment">Pascal can be experimented with using a free open source version - see</span>
<span class="Comment"><a href="https://wiki.freepascal.org/Main_Page">https://wiki.freepascal.org/Main_Page</a>.  freepascal has many mode where</span>
<span class="Comment">it uses more advanced versions of Pascal like Turbo Pascal or Delphi. I liked</span>
<span class="Comment">Delphi and used it for years.  In the 90's I would attend a Delphi users group</span>
<span class="Comment">in Culver City, CA.  With the advent of the internet and YouTube those</span>
<span class="Comment">types of groups went away.</span>

<span class="Comment">I created some other variations of FizzBuzz and put them on my Github.</span>
<span class="Comment">see <a href="https://github.com/elderdo/Fizz_Buzz">https://github.com/elderdo/Fizz_Buzz</a> </span>
<span class="Comment">While browsing github I found many variations of FizzBuzz and some were</span>
<span class="Comment">very amusing from a Geek standpoint. In 2007 Adam Lindsay created a programming</span>
<span class="Comment">language called LOLCODE. see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE</a> and</span>
<span class="Comment"><a href="http://www.lolcode.org/">http://www.lolcode.org/</a></span>

<span class="Comment">I then found this FizzBuzz program on github written in LOLCODE:</span>

<span class="Comment">Additional research on Google shows thousands of websites that explore this small,</span>
<span class="Comment">but useful program to test a person's basic programming skill at writing some code.</span>

<span class="Statement">program</span> FizzBuzz;
  <span class="Comment">{ Pascal requires all variables to be declared with their data type</span>
<span class="Comment">    such as integer, string, ... etc</span>
<span class="Comment">    see <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/pascal_data_types.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/pascal_data_types.htm</a> </span>
<span class="Comment">    The variable must be defined before the main begin end. block</span>
<span class="Comment">    of code, which is all the executable code for the program</span>
<span class="Comment">    that I've called FizzBuzz.</span>
<span class="Comment">    i is defined as a variable whose data type is an integer.  Pascal</span>
<span class="Comment">    will then only allow i to have counting numbers which can be negative:</span>
<span class="Comment">      ..... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .....</span>
<span class="Comment">  }</span>
<span class="Statement">var</span> i : <span class="Type">integer</span>;
<span class="Statement">begin</span>
  <span class="Comment">{ execute every statement between the begin and end 100 times</span>
<span class="Comment">    varying an integer variable called i from 1 to 100 incrementing</span>
<span class="Comment">    it by 1 for every execution of the begin end block of code.</span>
<span class="Comment">  }</span>
  <span class="Repeat">for</span> i := <span class="Constant">1</span> <span class="Repeat">to</span> <span class="Constant">100</span> <span class="Repeat">do</span>
  <span class="Statement">begin</span>
    <span class="Comment">{ the mod operator does division and returns the remainder</span>
<span class="Comment">      so i mod 3 divides i by 3 and returns a remainder and</span>
<span class="Comment">      is treated as an expression. So 3 mod 3 is an expression that</span>
<span class="Comment">      is equivalent to zero.</span>

<span class="Comment">      3 mod 3 = 0 tests if the remainder is zero.</span>
<span class="Comment">      So the if condition then write('......');</span>
<span class="Comment">      is a test. If the condition is true then write('.....') is executed</span>
<span class="Comment">      The Pascal write command sends whatever is in the parenthesis to</span>
<span class="Comment">      the screen.  A single quoted set of characters will have all the</span>
<span class="Comment">      characters between the single quotes sent to the screen.</span>
<span class="Comment">      When the variable i is used it sends the value of that variable at</span>
<span class="Comment">      that point in time.  write does not go to the next line of the </span>
<span class="Comment">      screen.  So, a write with 'Fizz' followed by a write with 'Buzz'</span>
<span class="Comment">      will send FizzBuzz to the screen.</span>
<span class="Comment">      The final statement in the begin .... end; block of code that is</span>
<span class="Comment">      executed 100 times is writeln();  That command sends the cursor</span>
<span class="Comment">      to the next line on the screen.  So one of the following is sent</span>
<span class="Comment">      to the screen on every loop through the begin end block:</span>

<span class="Comment">        Fizz</span>
<span class="Comment">        Buzz</span>
<span class="Comment">        FizzBuzz</span>
<span class="Comment">        or the value of i that is not divisible by 3 and is not divisible by</span>
<span class="Comment">        5.</span>

<span class="Comment">        the &lt;&gt; in Pascal means not equal.</span>
<span class="Comment">        the &quot;and&quot; between the two conditions means that both conditions</span>
<span class="Comment">        must be true.</span>

<span class="Comment">    }</span>
    <span class="Repeat">if</span> i <span class="Operator">mod</span> <span class="Constant">3</span> = <span class="Constant">0</span> <span class="Repeat">then</span> <span class="Function">write</span>(<span class="Constant">'Fizz'</span>);
    <span class="Repeat">if</span> i <span class="Operator">mod</span> <span class="Constant">5</span> = <span class="Constant">0</span> <span class="Repeat">then</span> <span class="Function">write</span>(<span class="Constant">'Buzz'</span>);
    <span class="Repeat">if</span> (i <span class="Operator">mod</span> <span class="Constant">5</span> &lt;&gt; <span class="Constant">0</span>) <span class="Operator">and</span> (i <span class="Operator">mod</span> <span class="Constant">3</span> &lt;&gt; <span class="Constant">0</span>) <span class="Repeat">then</span> <span class="Function">write</span>(i);
